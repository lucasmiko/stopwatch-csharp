# Stopwatch Console Application

This repository contains a small project developed during a fundamentals course on C#. The project is a stopwatch that operates via the console.

## Course Overview

The Fundamentals of C# course provided a foundational understanding of the C# programming language. As part of the course, a stopwatch project was developed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and techniques using C#. The stopwatch operates within a console environment.

## Features

- **C# Programming**: Learn fundamental concepts of the C# programming language.
- **Console Application**: Develop a stopwatch that operates via the console.
- **Time Tracking**: Measure elapsed time and display it on the console.
- **Start, Stop, and Reset**: Implement functionality to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
- **Console Input/Output**: Utilize console input/output mechanisms to interact with the stopwatch.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Stopwatch Console Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET 5 SDK or later: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

## Getting Started

To get started with the Stopwatch Console Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/lucasmiko/stopwatch-csharp.git`
2. Access the project directory: `cd stopwatch-csharp`
3. Build the solution: `dotnet build`
4. Run the application: `dotnet run`

Once the application is running, you can use the console to interact with the stopwatch and measure elapsed time.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Program.cs**: The main entry point of the console application.
- **Stopwatch.cs**: The class responsible for implementing the stopwatch functionality.
